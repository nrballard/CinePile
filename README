CinePile is a tool for tracking collections of movies and TV shows on tape and disc media. Ratings, release dates, runtimes, genre info, and plot synopses are accessed via the OMDb API and stored in a local database.

CinePile was created as a final project for the Harvard/EdX CS50x course and is written in JavaScript using JQuery Mobile, WebSQL, and PhoneGap.
